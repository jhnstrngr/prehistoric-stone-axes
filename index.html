                <div id="stones-text-small">Since 1936 archaeologists in the SWIPG have analysed stone axeheads to pinpoint the type of rock used and exactly where it came from. This is the longest running archaeological experiment and has produced two remarkable conclusions. Firstly, only a few sources of stone were selected by the prehistoric axe makers. Secondly, the axes made from those rocks were transported, sometimes great distances, by complex exchange networks.
                    This website, funded by Historic England, brings together this archaeological research with a catalogue of axes.</div>
